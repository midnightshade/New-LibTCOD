NEWTCOD roguelike that uses the python tutorial but in c++

This program is just me going on the tutorial from the LIBTCOD Site as seen here:

http://codeumbra.eu/complete-roguelike-tutorial-using-c-and-libtcod-part-1-setting-up

The libtcod library is needed for this as well as mingw. Libtcod can be found here: http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

I use code::blocks as my IDE.
